    <p id="theAboutParagraph" align='center'>Since other systems of measurement are still used around the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, this site aims to help people convert units of measurement with Metric Converter and Metric Conversion Table and to better understand alternative measurements that they are unfamiliar with. The measurement units are categorized into types (such as Temperature Conversion, Weight Conversion and so on) seen on the right-hand side which then lead to a series of metric conversion calculators.</p>
